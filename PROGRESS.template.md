## For New Translators

To translate a page:

1. Check that no one else has claimed your page in the checklist and comments below.
2. Comment below with the name of the page you would like to translate. **Take only one page at a time**.
3. Submit a PR and add it to your comment!

Before contributing, read the glossary and style guide (once they exist) to understand how to translate various technical and React-specific terms.

You can use the [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/react) as a base for your translation. Make sure to compare the content with the current React website to makes sure everything is up to date! (NOTE: delete this if the language doesn't have any Crowdin contributions)

Please be prompt with your translations! If you find find that you can't commit any more, let the maintainers know so they can assign the page to someone else.

## For maintainers

When someone volunteers, edit this issue with the username of the volunteer, and with the PR. Ex:

* [ ] Home Page (@tesseralis) #1

When PRs are merged, make sure to mark that page as completed!
